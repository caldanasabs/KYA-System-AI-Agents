# Know Your Agent (KYA): A Decentralized ID for AI Agents


## What's This Project All About?

Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out the **Know Your Agent (KYA)** project. Right now, this repo is home to the big whitepaper I've put together, laying out a new way to give AI agents their own unique identity.

It's pretty wild how fast AI is moving, right? We're talking about AI that can actually *do stuff* on its own â€” buy things, talk to other systems, all that jazz. But for this to really work, and for us to trust it, we gotta know *who* these AI agents are. It's about security, knowing who's accountable, and just building confidence in this whole new digital space.

My paper dives into how we can use a cool combo of tech: the **Solana blockchain** (super fast, super reliable) to lock in an agent's identity using an NFT (think of it like their digital ID card), and **GitHub** for all their detailed info. GitHub's great because it keeps everything transparent and lets us track changes. I figure this mix tackles a bunch of identity problems AI agents face, setting us up for a more trustworthy future.

## Quick Look at What's Inside the Paper

In the whitepaper, I dig into some core ideas that really shape the KYA vision:

* **Agentic AI:** What does it mean for AI to actually be an "agent" that acts on its own? I explore that.
* **Decentralized ID:** Imagine AI agents having control over their own identity info, not some big central company. That's the goal.
* **Solana NFTs:** How these unique digital tokens on Solana become the unchangeable pointer to an AI agent's official KYA identity.
* **GitHub KYA Profile:** I break down how each AI agent gets its own GitHub spot, loaded with details about what it can do, what it's allowed to access, and so on.
* **Crypto Verification:** This is key! I explain how we use fancy math (digital signatures and blockchain magic) to prove an AI agent is legit before it does anything important.

## More on the KYA Whitepaper

This whitepaper really is the heart of what I'm doing here. I poured a ton of effort into figuring out the whole KYA system, from how it's designed to the nitty-gritty tech stuff, and why I think it's such a game-changer for AI.

* **Title:** Know Your Agent (KYA): A Decentralized Identification Layer for Agentic AI
* **Abstract:** The rapid proliferation of autonomous AI agents necessitates a standardized, secure, and verifiable method for identification and authorization. Current identity and access management (IAM) solutions, designed primarily for human users, are ill-equipped to handle the unique requirements of agentic AI. This whitepaper introduces the "Know Your Agent" (KYA) system, a novel decentralized identity framework that leverages the immutability of the Solana blockchain and the version control capabilities of GitHub. The KYA system provides each AI agent with a unique, cryptographically verifiable identity, enabling secure commerce, granular permissioning, and transparent interactions across diverse platforms. We detail the system's architecture, including its GitHub-based profile management, Solana NFT integration, robust security protocols, and strategies for schema evolution and error handling. By establishing a native, auditable identity layer for AI agents, KYA paves the way for a trustworthy and highly efficient agentic future in the digital economy.

## What's Next for KYA?

Right now, it's all about the whitepaper. But if this idea picks up steam, I've got some big plans for where KYA could go:

* **Building the Solana Smart Contract:** Getting that core `kya_program` written in Rust and running on Solana.
* **Standardizing the KYA Profile:** Working on official ways to define different types of agents and what they can do.
* **Making Dev Tools:** Creating SDKs and other tools to make it easy for developers to plug KYA into their AI agents and other platforms.
* **Real-World Demos:** Building some actual examples to show KYA in action.
* **Community & Governance:** Thinking about how we could build a community or even a DAO to help steer where the KYA standard goes.

## Want to Get Involved?

I'd genuinely love your input! Since it's just the whitepaper in here for now, I'm super keen on:

* **Your Thoughts on the Paper:** Seriously, hit me with your feedback. Anything that could make it clearer, or cool technical ideas you have.
* **Just Chatting:** Feel free to open an issue to talk about KYA concepts, new uses, or where this whole thing could head.
